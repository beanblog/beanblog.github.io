This is my first test blog post. I've reinstalled Ruby and Jekyll
on my machine and it appears to be working now. After all that
fiddling and fussing it's exciting to finally have a platform
up and running. Though it may look like shit right  now, pretty soon
it'll be filled with blog posts about farming, baking, skating,
writing, reading, and all things bean.

This concludes my first blog post. <3 The Wasted Youth.
